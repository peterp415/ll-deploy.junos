# Need these only for connection: local

# Explanation of the `connection: local` problem,
# from https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/16724
#
# To clarify:
#
# These are identical: local_action:, delegate_to: localhost
# both of them change the target to 'localhost' and the task then uses the
# ansible_python_interpreter and ansible_connection defined for localhost.
#
# If you don't define a localhost, Ansible creates an implicit one which
# assigns sys.executable (python under which ansible itself is executed) to
# ansible_python_interpreter AND ansible_connection: local.
# If you define localhost, you are responsible for the rest of the host vars.
#
# Using connection: local does NOT change the target host, so any variables
# set for the remote are kept, ansible_python_interpreter is conserved (even
# when undefined). So you might need to set it for that specific task.
